Issue Tracker a Free Code Camp Project

* You can send a POST request to ***/api/issues/{projectname}*** with form data containing the required fields ***issue_title, issue_text, created_by, and optionally assigned_to and status_text***.

* The POST request to ***/api/issues/{projectname}*** will return the created object, and will include all of the submitted fields. Excluded optional fields will be returned as empty strings. Additionally, include created_on (date/time), updated_on (date/time), open (boolean, true for open - default value, false for closed), and _id.

* If you send a POST request to ***/api/issues/{projectname}*** without the required fields, returned will be the error ***{ error: 'required field(s) missing' }***

* You can send a GET request to ***/api/issues/{projectname}*** for an array of all issues for that specific projectname, with all the fields present for each issue.

* You can send a GET request to ***/api/issues/{projectname}*** and filter the request by also passing along any field and value as a URL query ***(ie. /api/issues/{project}?open=false)***. You can pass one or more field/value pairs at once.

* You can send a PUT request to ***/api/issues/{projectname}*** with an _id and one or more fields to update. On success, the updated_on field should be updated, and returned should be ***{  result: 'successfully updated', '_id': _id }***.

* When the PUT request sent to ***/api/issues/{projectname}*** does not include an _id, the return value is ***{ error: 'missing _id' }***.

* When the PUT request sent to ***/api/issues/{projectname}*** does not include update fields, the return value is ***{ error: 'no update field(s) sent', '_id': _id }***. On any other error, the return value is ***{ error: 'could not update', '_id': _id }***.

* You can send a DELETE request to ***/api/issues/{projectname}*** with an ***_id*** to delete an issue. If no _id is sent, the return value is ***{ error: 'missing _id' }***. On success, the return value is ***{ result: 'successfully deleted', '_id': _id }***. On failure, the return value is ***{ error: 'could not delete', '_id': _id }***.


## Notes:
* good ressource for updating a subdocument in mongoose: https://dev.to/danimalphantom/adding-updating-and-removing-subdocuments-with-mongoose-1dj5

* "using the main database for testing purposes is not ideal since we’re polluting the database with test data. Instead, we need to utilize a test database and add a dummy data to it to assert against. To do this, we can use the beforeEach() and afterEach() hooks - which, as the names suggest, add and remove a dummy document to the database before and after each test case is ran."

    * adding a configuration file called config.js to the “server” folder in order to specify a different database URI for testing purposes


    * app.settings.env : to detect what environment an expressJS app is running in (development, test, production)
